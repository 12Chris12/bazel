<h1 id="modules.list">list</h1>

A language built-in type to support lists. Example of list literal:<br><pre class=language-python>x = [1, 2, 3]</pre>Accessing elements is possible using indexing (starts from <code>0</code>):<br><pre class=language-python>e = x[1]   # e == 2</pre>Lists support the <code>+</code> operator to concatenate two lists. Example:<br><pre class=language-python>x = [1, 2] + [3, 4]   # x == [1, 2, 3, 4]
x = ["a", "b"]
x += ["c"]            # x == ["a", "b", "c"]</pre>List elements have to be of the same type, <code>[1, 2, "c"]</code> results in an error. Lists - just like everything - are immutable, therefore <code>x[1] = "a"</code> is not supported.
